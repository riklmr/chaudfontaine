# Some ideas for testing
- table guaranteed to be complete
- table with hole(s)
- table not complete (current month)
- table with commented values
- table with non-validated values (again: current month)
- table that does not exist (before installation date)
- table that cannot exist (in a future month)
- URL that is complete and correct
- URL for a non existing table
- URL with one or more parameters missing
